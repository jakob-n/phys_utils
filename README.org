* Physics Utils
The name is merely here to have something somewhat descriptive.
This repository contains all sorts of different small programs and headers that are developed as small tools during other work.
It is not all strictly related to physics but from a programming point of view, but most (if not all) of it is used in a physics environment.

Most of this will be written in c++11 and probably won't compile below (that is unless I have needed it somewhere where c++11 was not available).
Also most of this will concern ROOT.
